A rebuild of my website with a C++ backend.
Currently using [md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c) for parsing and [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) for web backend.

I've mostly been using this as a chance to explore my thoughts on low-level-ish, low power code. 
Because of this I've been trying to use the simplest fastest libraries I can find and create a 
very bare-bones implementation that does the bare minimum. Ideally as a finished product this code
should simply take md files in and produce html files in the style of my site that it hosts along
with one or two other pages.
