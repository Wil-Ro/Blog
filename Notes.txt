very useful^^


seems like the paths you're using are wrong,, this is kind of a guess
but try working out if the directories you include i.e. ../Src are meant
to be from pc root rather than the projects root

chat gpt says it should be relative since the whole point of cmake is to be
dynamic and cross platform

IM A FOOL
I was importing the wrong file

Ok, weird error with the compiler failing to create a vtable, our abstract class was missing some stuff it needed so it wasnt making the vtable for the super-class of component. This was solved by giving them the inline definition of "= 0". This is C++'s equivalent of an abstract method, see below post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3065154/undefined-reference-to-vtable
