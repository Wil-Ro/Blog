<p>I'm Rosia Evans, this is my site where I log my work for myself and for me to show to others.</p>
<p>This site is generated procedurally from markdown though C++ code I've written and hosted using <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> on an old laptop through my router. You can find the code for it <a href="https://github.com/Wil-Ro/Blog">here</a> and a more indepth talk about it on <a href="/ThisSite.html">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>I'm currently studying at a small university in wales where I'm doing a BEng in software engineering whilst working on robotics and exploring my own interests on the side through various societies and personal projects.</p>
<img src="profile.jpeg" alt="image of me" style="width:50%">
<p>Nowadays my interests lie mostly in low-power computing and electronics, experimenting with how computers can work in a more environmentally friendly manner. I find the environment is something I think about a lot and finding overlaps between it and my interests in computing has lead me to some really intersting communities.</p>
<p>On the side of this I also enjoy using code to create music through programming using <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic-Pi</a> and just creating programs in general with friends and colleagues. Most of my work can either be found in blog-posts here or on my <a href="https://github.com/Wil-Ro">github</a>.</p>
<p>I've previously had interests in VR and XR and UI design, spending a lot of my secondary school years experimenting with both concepts so both websites also have a few probjects relating to those concepts.</p>

<p>If you want a basic outline of my work, here are a few interesting projects:</p>
