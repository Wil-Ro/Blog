            <article><h1>Mind Map Maker</h1>
<p>This project was completed for my computer science A-level. Students had to find a client and create a program for them, I chose my sister and created software to help her revise for her GCSE's.
The software had to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run on her Â£70 laptop</li>
<li>allow for files to be transfered between devices</li>
<li>allow actions to be undone and redone</li>
<li>be generic enough to work for any subject</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time I was finding myself really interested in intuitive UI design so I also aimed to create a simple and unrestrictive system that I felt was easy to learn and use. Though I found I had to cut a lot of it for time constraints.</p>
<p>We were given 24 hours spread over 2 months to create the program and were allowed to choose our own langauges and frameworks.
I chose to write the sofware in Unity as I wanted to learn a new engine and knew that unitys use of scenegraphs
would let me avoud calculating the scaling and positioning of mind map components.</p>
<p>As one of the software requirements was to run on very low end computers I also had to ensure I was creating scripts that would run as efficiently as possible when compiled, so I ended up
finding myself weighing up the strengths and weaknesses of different libraries, often choosing ones with drawbacks in favour of their lower usage of memory.</p>
<h2>The outcome</h2>

<p>The final system had a number of features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully working undo/redo system</li>
<li>The ability to create and link text bubbles</li>
<li>The ability to import images</li>
<li>A drawing tool, along with options to optimise lines for slower pcs</li>
<li>A save and load system</li>
<li>A settings panel</li>
<li>The ability to navigate and magnify the mindmap</li>
</ul>
