<h2>What it is</h2>
<p>This project was completed as a large percentage of my final A-level computer science grade. Every student had to choose a language or development framework and create a program for a client, whilst most students chose to
create video games for their siblings, I chose to create mind map software as my sister was soon to start her GCSEs and was struggling to revise. The software had to run on a Â£70 laptop and allow for files to be transfered between
copies of the software. I also aimed to create an intuitive and relatively unrestrictive system as my sister was an art student and had little experience with digital design software.</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>
<p>I independently created this program over the course of 24 hours spread over 2 months. I chose to write the sofware in Unity as I wanted to learn a new engine and knew that unitys use of scenegraphs
would make the process of development alot faster as I wouldn't have to calculate scales and positions of mind map components as unity would do this all in the background, allowing me to focus on the larger aspects of the project. <br> <br>
As one of the software requirements was to run on very low end computers I also had to ensure I was creating scripts that would run as efficiently as possible when compiled, this regularly meant having to
weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of different libraries, often choosing ones with drawbacks in favour of their lower usage of memory.</p>
