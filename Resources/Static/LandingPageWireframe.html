                I'm currently studying at a small university in wales where I'm doing a BEng in
                software engineering whilst working on robotics and exploring my own interests
                on the side through various societies. I've previously had interests in VR and XR
                and UI design, spending a lot of my secondary school years experimenting with both
                concepts.
