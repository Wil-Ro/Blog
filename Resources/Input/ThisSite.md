# This Site

This site is a small project I worked on over the course of a few weeks while first returning back to university during my second year. Its hosted on a small [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) server running on an old laptop from around 2003. I wrote a small C++ program that takes in MarkDown files and builds them into webpages. Everytime the server turns on it pulls from a repo, builds the code and runs it, this then builds the website and puts them in a folder for lighttpd to host.

## The thoughts behind this

During my first year at university I read a lot around the concept of [Permacomputing](http://permacomputing.net/). This is a set of ideas around reusing old computers and writing small systems that avoid [code rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) and use as little power as possible.
The driving idea behind this being that we've had computers that are powerful enough for most small jobs for quite a long time and realistically a lot of old e-waste is still perfectly good for these kind of small low-risk jobs and can be used in an eco-friendly way when worked with correctly.

I'd been reading into Permacomputing for a decent while but never properly had the chance to experiment with my thoughts on it. Along with that I'd also spent time doing a module in my first year on the history of the internet and found the www's origins really inspiring
