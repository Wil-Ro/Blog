# Welcome!
I'm Rosia Evans, this is my site where I log my work for myself and for me to show to others.

I'm currently studying at a small university in wales where I'm doing a BEng in software engineering whilst working on robotics and exploring my own interests on the side through various societies. I've previously had interests in VR and XR and UI design, spending a lot of my secondary school years experimenting with both concepts.
